#use this to attribute csv with location in name and x,y and group type
  #use this to do related acts (on demand api call)
    # get top 5 candidates, create object with band name, type, location
    # get location and bind to object, those with no location drop
    # add graphics to new layer
    # zoom to extent of these 


issues with certain acts not processing in desktop py scripts 
issues with unicode

i focused on getting a comphrehensive dataset, this solution is meant to be scalable for new acts that will abide by 

176/301 did not get location for band start date
didn't take into consideration bands maybe be two major members how really have solo careers

born vs origin vs where they identify with. 
This paper/data source does not seek to prove this is their origin, rather how this can be mapped. Location could even be a one to many relationships
with artists. Visualizing tour information as they move throughout time.

names of artists were not necessarly just band/artist info. THis required manual parsing (Hanson Holiday Tiny Desk Concert)


The bands visit was a play, how to locate.
